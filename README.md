# cohabitaters

A little web app to generate a Christmas card address list from [Google Contacts](https://contacts.google.com/).

I like to store my data centrally but Google doesn't make it easy to aggregate contacts by where they live. I don't want to send multiple cards to the same address.

## Local Development

Cohabitaters uses several platforms and libraries.
* [htmx](https://htmx.org/) for the front-end
* [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [Flowbite](https://flowbite.com/) for CSS and basic UI components
* [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) for icons
* [Go](https://go.dev/) for the back-end
* [Air](https://github.com/cosmtrek/air) for live reloading

Local dev is driven from the top-level Makefile:
```
❯ make bin/cohab-server
cd cmd/cohab-server && go build -o ../../bin/cohab-server
❯ make air

[Dockerfile.fedora](Dockerfile.fedora) contains an example showing the build dependencies needed for `make check` to succeed.

## Deployment

This tool requires a [GCP](https://cloud.google.com/) Project for access to the [People API](https://developers.google.com/people). For simplicity, that configuration is tracked in [Terraform](https://terraform.io).

### Initial Import

```
$ cd terraform && terraform import google_project_service.people_api xmas-card-addresses/people.googleapis.com
```

### Deploy Locally

`make air` will build and launch the web server and repeat when any source files have changed. By default the server will listen on `localhost:8080`.

### Deploy locally with Podman

Use `cohab-server-dev-podman.sh`:

```
  ❯ deploy/cohab-server-dev-podman.sh

```

### Deploy remotely

The final version gets deployed to [fly.io](https://fly.io/).

Prerequisite 1: create the DNS record and then the certificate:

```
❯ flyctl certs create cohabitaters.bfallik.net
```

Prerequisite 2: create the applications secret from the downloaded OAuth2 client credentials:

```
❯ flyctl secrets set GOOGLE_APP_CREDENTIALS="$(< path/to/downloaded/client_secret.json)"
```

Then just:
```
❯ flyctl deploy
```
